SafeContract.sol is a simple SC that allows users to deposit, transfer, and withdraw ETH. It lacks robust control measures and validations, with the most critical vulnerability found in the function that updates user balances. Due to the incorrect use of visibility modifiers, this function allows anyone to modify any balance. The attacker contract is designed to exploit this vulnerability.

The test consists of three parts:

- Arbitrary balance modification: Simply verifies that balances can be arbitrarily modified, demonstrating the vulnerability.
- Full balance exploitation: Checks the total balance of the vulnerable contract, assigns it to the attacker's account, withdraws it, and transfers it to the attacker's owner's address.
- Single transaction exploitation: Performs the exploit in a single transaction, showcasing the attacker's ability to fully exploit the contract.

## To run the test suite follow this steps:

- Install Rust:

```
sudo snap install rustup --classic
rustup update stable
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

- Install Foundry:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

- Create the project folder:

```
mkdir safeContractTest
cd safeContractTest
```

- Configure Git for the current project (if it hasn't been configured previously):

```
git config user.email <yourEmail>
git config user.name <yourName>
```

- Initialize a new project:

```
forge init --force
```

- Install dependencies:

```
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit
```

- Add the smart contracts and test file:

Place SafeContract.sol and Attacker.sol in the src/ directory.

Place TestingDaAttack.sol in the test/ directory.

- Run the test:

```
forge test
```

### Warning:
"Exploiting vulnerabilities should only be done ethically, with permission, and for constructive purposes such as improving security. Unauthorized exploitation can cause harm, breach trust, and lead to legal consequences. This exploit is intended solely for educational purposes to raise awareness about the importance of implementing good security practices."
